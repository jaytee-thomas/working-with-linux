# Exercise 2: Create Files and Directories

You have joined a new project team in your organization. To work on the project, the team lead has asked you to organize some project data on your newly assigned Linux system. ​

​For this, you need to create some files and directories as per the guidelines provided.  ​

# Tasks:

Create a new directory: Project_Data​

Create three new files in the directory: ​

day_vise_activity_log.txt​

week_vise_activity_log.txt​

temp_log.txt​

Run the ls command to check that the files and directory have been created. ​

Identify the relative and absolute path of day_vise_activity_log.txt ​

Delete the temp_log.txt file from the directory. This file is a temporary log file that should be removed regularly.​

​
Note: For this exercise, you may put some dummy text in these files.​
